Your task is to create a class that simulates a Rolodex, then use it to implement a word-sorting program. The program starts with an empty -Rolodex, then reads words from standard input and adds a card for each word in the appropriate position to maintain overall sorted order. To find the correct position, the Rolodex is rolled either backwards or forwards from the current card. When all input has been processed, the program moves the -Rolodex to the beginning and then outputs each word -in order, one per line.
